                  <p>Broadly, my academic interests were in Riemannian geometry and geometric analysis. More specifically, my background and training was in spectral geometry,
                  where one is interested in the interplay between the geometry of a manifold and the spectrum of some geometrically motivated differential operator (e.g. the Laplace-Beltrami operator).
                   In my PhD thesis I investigated the singularities of the wave trace on lens spaces and flat manifolds (the so-called Poisson relation).
                   After getting my PhD in Mathematics at Dartmouth College, I spent a year at Universit&eacute Laval, where I was a CRM Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Mathematics. At Laval I worked with
                   <a href = "https://archimede.mat.ulaval.ca/agirouard/">Alexandre Girouard</a> on questions related to the Steklov spectrum. After Laval, I did another post-doc at the University of Michigan. At Michigan, I branched out to investigate questions motivated by mathematical physics, fluid mechanics and numerical analysis.

                        <li>Semi-classical incarnations of the Inverse Spectral Method: The inverse spectral method has been used to study,
                          among other things, the continuous limit of the Toda lattice and the dispersionless limit of the KdV equation.
                          Alejandro Uribe and I investigated an analog of the inverse spectral method for a class of "tri-diagonal"
                          Toeplitz operators obtained from quantizing the 2-sphere. The work was inspired by this <a
                          href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.dmj/1085598341">article</a>. Our preliminary results can be found <a href="semi-classical_inverse_spectral_method.pdf">here</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>Point vortex dynamics: Point vortices provide a useful toy model for helping to understand vorticity in
                          fluid flows. They also have many connections to other areas of mathematics, e.g. dynamical systems,
                          Hamiltonian dynamics and potential theory.
                          J&ouml;rn Zimmerling and I mentored three undergraduates in a
                          <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/logm/projects/winter-2020-projects/">Lab of Geometry</a> project
                          where we investigated the dynamics of the vortices whose motion is confined to a curved surface (like a
                          sphere or a torus). The video to the right is a simulation of three planar vortices in an equilateral triangle
                          configuration where the vortices are known to steadily rotate around the center of the triangle.
